Both wxPython and the wxWidgets library it is built upon are mature
projects that are still actively developed.  wxPython's history started
before the turn of the century, back in 1996. wxWidgets was already around
4 years old by then, you can see more details about the history of wxWidgets
[here](https://www.wxwidgets.org/about/history/).

## History according to Robin

In 1995 I was working on a project that needed a GUI to be
deployed on HP-UX systems, but my boss also wanted to show something
at a trade show on his Windows 3.1 laptop in a few weeks time.  So I
started searching for a cross platform C++ GUI toolkit to do a
prototype with. In those days it wasn't so easy without Google, but I
found that there were several commercial alternatives available (none
of which are still available today) and lots of toolkits with
freely available source.

While evaluating each of the free toolkits for my immediate needs and
deciding which of the commercial offerings would be best for our long
term needs I ran into the term "Python bindings" on the wxWidgets web
site (in this case "binding" refers to the connection between the
Python language and the wxWidgets toolkit).  Full of curiosity at how
one would "bind" a software toolkit to a reptile (I had never heard of
the Python language up to this point), I clicked on the link, and the
next link, and the next, until I finally ended up at the Python 1.2
Tutorial document.  Three hours later I was converted from being the
local C++ Guru to a Python Evangelist bugging all the developers in
the immediate vicinity showing them the cool new thing I had
discovered.

So instead of working on my prototype I worked with Harri Pasanen in
Finland to advance the Python bindings for wxWidgets, otherwise known
as wxPython 0.2, also with some help from Edward Zimmerman. <!-- The
mailing list announcement of that release is archived
[here](http://www.google.com/groups?selm=PA.95Jul27032244%40ok.tekla.fi&oe=UTF-8). -->
We got it to be functional enough that I could do my prototype for my
boss using Python, but wxPython was a nightmare to maintain and to
enhance because everything (C++ extension module code, Python proxy
modules, build system, etc.) was all done by hand, and little changes
or enhancements to wxWidgets would often require changes to several
places in wxPython code to add the support for the enhancement or fix
to wxPython.  When it reached many tens of thousands of lines of code
it got to be very awkward and fragile to work on in that manner.  Add
to that the fact that there was no central source code repository
(this was also long before [SourceForge](http://sf.net/)'s time) and
so we were emailing code changes to each other and you can get an
inkling for the difficulties involved.

About that time I had to start doing real work again as my main
project at work started to build up from a gleam in the eye to a full
force development project with several developers under my control and
design meetings and deadlines and all that, and I found myself fully back in the C++
world again, (although I was able to use Python for some of the build and
test scripts for the project.)  Harri also wasn't able to spend any
time on it, and so wxPython development slowed to less than a crawl
and eventually pretty much stopped.

In 1997 I discovered SWIG (the Simple Wrapper and Interface Generator,)
and realized that it could help with all the
maintenance issues that pained us in the wxPython project.  In about
three or four weeks worth of spare time I almost completely
reimplemented using SWIG everything (and more!) that had taken several
weeks of almost full time on my part and several months of part time
for Harri doing it by hand. After getting sidetracked on another
project for a while I discovered that wxWidgets 2.0 was in active
development, but had a whole new architecture, so I had to do it all
again.  But this time the new architecture simplified things enough
that it took only about a weeks worth of spare time!  So in the summer
of 1998 the first "modern version" of wxPython was released and has
been in active development ever since.  The first announcement is
archived [here](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/python-announce-list/message/95).

The rest is, as they say, history.  It's important to note however
that SWIG is allowing me to easily create and maintain literally
hundreds of thousands of lines of code, so much of the credit for the
vastness of wxPython's feature set deserves to go to David Beazley and
the other developers contributing to that project.

## "Recent" Changes

The "recent" changes page of wxPython goes all the way back to release 0.3
in 1998. That was a long time ago, with many releases made since then. The
changelog is updated for each release and is viewable [here](/pages/changes).
