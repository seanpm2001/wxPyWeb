## "An attitude of gratitude"

**wxPython 4.1.1** is now available at
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.1.1), with some additional files at
[Extras](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/)

New and improved in this release:

* This should have been mentioned in the notes for the last release, but alas,
  it wandered away and got lost. wxWidgets is now validating the flags passed
  when adding items to a sizer, to ensure that they are the correct flags for
  the type of the sizer. If the given flags do not make sense, for example using
  horizontal alignment flags in a horizontal box sizer, then a wxAssertionError
  error is raised.

* Fixed missing binder for EVT_STC_AUTOCOMP_SELECTION_CHANGE. [#1613](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1613)

* DataViewModel.HasValue can be overridden and will inform the DataViewCtrl
  whether or not an item and column has data. If HasValue returns False, then
  GetValue for that item/col will not be called. This allows a distinction
  between a truly empty cell, and one that has a value even if it is an empty
  string. [#1600](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1600)

* Added flag that allows blocking of item dragging in the UltimateListControl
  class. [PR#1620](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1620)

* Add the column index to notification events in UltimateListControl [PR#1630](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1630)

* Added orientation parameter to UltimateListControl.GetScrollPos. [PR#1632](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1632)

* wx.lib.agw.aui.AuiNotebook RemovePage() now hides the removed page, so it
  needs to be shown again if it is reused in another place. [PR#1668](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1668)

* Fixed issue that could modify `bytes` objects under Python. [PR#1680](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1680)

* Added wx.lib.agw.aui.EVT_AUI_PANE_CLOSE event which is sent when a AUI (the
  agw version) Pane has been closed (after it has been closed, not when it is
  about to be closed, which is when EVT_AUI_PANE_CLOSE is sent.) [PR#1628](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/pull/1628)

* Exposed the wx.DC methods GetGraphicsContext and SetGraphicsContext. Depending
  on the platform and the type of the DC, there may be a wx.GraphicsContext used
  for the implementation of the DC. If so, the GetGraphicsContext method enables
  access to it. Be sure to check that the return value is not None before trying
  to use it.

* Simplified the implementation of the wx.App.InitLocale method. See the
  MigrationGuide for more information.

* Added wx.lib.agw.aui.AUI_DOCKART_HINT_WINDOW_BORDER_COLOUR constant
  so the hint window border color can be themed as well.

* The wx.lib.mixins.listCtrl.CheckListCtrlMixin is now obsolete because
  wx.ListCtrl has new functionality which does pretty much the same thing. In
  fact there is some overlap in method names which may trip up some use cases.
  It is advised to drop the use of CheckListCtrlMixin and just use the
  wx.ListBox functionality. You will need to call EnableCheckBoxes to turn it on,
  and you may need to change some event handlers or overloaded methods.

* wx.html2.WebView is now able to use Microsoft's Edge browser component as its
  backend renderer. This should improve the capabilities of the WebView widget
  on Windows, and be more consistent with the WebViews on the other platforms,
  compared to the original IE 11 backend. Using this backed requires that a
  new-ish version of the Edge browser is installed on the end user's computer.

* Added the wx.Image.ConvertToRegion method. This lets you create a wx.Region
  from an image and a specified color or the mask if the image has one. This
  was done to workaround a bug in wxMac, but it seems worthwhile enough to keep
  it around even after the bug was fixed.

* Added the missing context manager methods for wx.LogNull. [#1842](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1842)

* Refactored ScrolledThumbnail out of agw.ThumbnailCtrl so as to be usable
  outside of ThumbnailCtrl.
