## "Rumors of my death are only slightly exaggerated"

**wxPython 4.2.0** is now available at
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.2.0), with some additional files at
[Extras](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/)

New and improved in this release:

* Yes, it's been a VERY long time since the last release. I'm not dead, just on
  an extended break. It took me a while to get up to speed on a new day job, and
  then there was a seemingly perpetual crunch-mode to get the product through a
  couple release cycles. I can't say that things are fully back to normal yet,
  but at least I now know what I'm doing. Mostly. &lt;wink&gt;

* This release is built using the wxWidgets' 3.2.0 release tag.

* Tweaked the build scripts a bit to ensure that on non-Windows platforms that
  the compiler and flags used by default match those used by wxWidgets, (with
  the flags needed by Python added on.) The compiler commands can be overridden
  by setting CC and CXX in the environment if needed. [#1247](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1247)

* On Windows the build code that locates and sets up the environment for the
  MSVC compiler no longer relies on distutils code, but is now using more modern
  code in setuptools instead. This enables much more compiler flexibility and
  wxPython should now be buildable with Visual Studio versions from 2015 through
  2022+.

* Switched to SIP 6 for generating the wrapper code. Rather than a standalone
  executable, SIP is now a Python package that needs to be installed in the
  Python environment used for the build. A dependency has been added to
  requirements/devel.txt to help ensure that the correct version is installed.
  The wx.siplib module code is no longer kept in the repository, but is
  generated during the build.

* Changed wx.App.InitLocale to just do `locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "C")`
  to undo what Python (3.8+ on Windows) does. This lets wxWidgets start with an
  uninitialized locale as it expects. [#1637](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1637)

* Fixed issues related to `time_t` always being treated as a 32-bit value on
  Windows. [#1910](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1910)

* Added wx.FullScreenEvent and wx.EVT_FULLSCREEN.

* The legacy, OSX-Only wx.webkit module has been removed.

* Fix building wxPython with Python 3.10 on Windows [#2016](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2016)

* Fix PyProgress on Windows by avoiding invalid sizer flags [#1985](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1985)

* Fix 'More Grid Features' in demo

* Many of the widgets which deal with bitmaps have been changed to use a
  wx.BitmapBundle object instead of wx.Bitmap. This is the mechanism which
  wxWidgets has implemented for adapting to things like Hi-DPI displays.
  Essentially you can load a list of bitmaps of different sizes (but similar or
  scaled content) into a wx.BitmapBundle, and the widget can choose one based on
  the display density. Existing code should be able to continue to pass a
  wx.Bitmap to the widget constructor or to methods like SetBitmap, as wxPython
  will automatically convert from a wx.Bitmap to a wx.BitmapBundle containing
  the single image provided.

* Add support for new wx.grid event, EVT_GRID_ROW_MOVE

* Fix path issues in wx.lib.agw.multidirdialog [#2120](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2120)

* Fix eventwatcher checkAll(check=False) [#2139](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2139)

* Fix exception on grid labels click [#1841](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1841)

* Fix a large number of Python 3.10 issues.  In Python 3.10, a change was
  implemented where extension functions that take integer arguments will no
  longer silently accept non-integer arguments (e.g., floats) that can only be
  converted to integers with a loss of precision.  Fixed most of these issues
  in the pure-Python classes and demos by explicitly converting the parameters
  to int before passing them to wxWidgets.  There is loss of precision, but
  this was happening before (automatically) anyway as most wxWidgets
  DeviceContext functions operate using integers.

* Fix PlotCanvas point label drawing on Linux

* Fix GetPopupMenu override for wx.adv.TaskbarIcon [#2067](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2067)

* Fix invisible text in lib.plot with dark theme

* Add new button type: ShowHideToggleButton.  Like a ToggleButton, but with an
  associated "menu", a Window or Sizer which is shown/hidden when button is
  toggled. Includes methods for setting active and inactive fore/background
  colours.

* Fix unbinding of events in FIFO order [#2027](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2027)

* Enable customization of layout of pdfviewer button panel

* Support newer PyMuPDF versions [#2205](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2205)

* IntCtrl: Change default colour to wx.NullColour so the default color will be
  used. [#2215](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2215)

* Change PopupControl to respect all the parameters passed to its init method.
  [#2218](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2218)

* Fixes in flatmenu.py Remove and DestroyItem [#2219](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2219)

* Using the MinGW toolchain to build wxPython has been simplified a bit. [#2211](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/2211)
